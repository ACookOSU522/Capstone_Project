Preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including decision-making process.

Out of the data that was left after pre-processing, we found that the most relevant columns to determine land and ocean average temperature are "LandAverageTemperature", "LandMaxTemperature", and, "LandMinTemperature". We also found that it did not make sense to use "LandAndOceanAverageTemperature" to predict any of the other variables, so we made this our target variable. Considering the data we had included features and targets, the best way to map the data was through supervised machine learning.

Description of how data was split into train and test set

 Considering we have about 1992 rows of data after pre-processing, we found that training about 75% of the data, to then test on 25% of the data was the best split.

Model choice including advantages and disadvantages

 Since our target value is continuous, we decided that a multiple linear regression model was best. The advantages associated with this model include being simple to implement, the algorithm works best when there is a clear linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Some disadvantages include that it assumes a straight-line relationship between independent and dependent variables, it does not take into account the attributes involved, outliers can have great impact on the data, and since linear regression looks at the relationship between the mean of the variables, the whole story and description of variables is not being told.
