## Overview/ Purpose
Reviewing Kaggle Dataset for Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature to predict climate changes by Country and in global Major Cities
1- Cleaning the datasets to remove years prior to 1900 then narrowing down from 2000-2013, dropping NaN, filtered for Northern Hemisphere data only.
2- Splitting data into (items) using (database item),
3- Supervised machine learning models (process, train, test, predict) and include results (items) and why choose specific model[confusion matrix and imbalance classification reports and random forest classifier(top items)], 
4- Visulazation answering questions and dashboard items(interactive(dashboard buttons) and static(tableau))

Questions to answer:
1- Will the early 2000's weather trends indicate an increase in Earth surface temperature?
2- What are the increases in temperature in (2 or 5 or 10 year) time steps?
3- Do major cities impact climate change heavier?
4- Predict climate change for 2025CE-2100CE in 10 year increments
5- [API calls for major city in x country]
6-
