## Overview/ Purpose
Reviewing Kaggle Dataset for Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature, and Eighty years of Canadian climate data to predict climate changes for 3 major cities (Lagos, Montreal, and Shianghai)
1- Cleaning the datasets to remove years prior to 1900 then narrowing down from 2000-2013, dropping NaN, filtered for Northern Hemispheres and further broken down by 3 cities data only.

2- Splitting data into (items) using PgAdmin,

3- Supervised machine learning models (process, train, test, predict) and include results (items) and why choose specific model[confusion matrix and imbalance classification reports and random forest classifier(top items)], 

4- Visulazation answering questions and dashboard items(interactive(dashboard buttons) and static(tableau))

Questions to answer:

1- Will the 2000-2013 weather trends indicate an increase in Earth surface temperature for Lagos, Nigeria; Shanghai, China and Montreal, Canada?

2- What are the global increases in average temperature over time?

3- Do major cities impact climate change heavier?

4- Does relation to the equator have an effect?

5- What model would best perdict future climate change?

## Summary/ Improvements
 Improvments for future data testing, locate cities closer to ocean temperature affected bodies of water (large lakes or icebergs), would increase data availabe for more accurate predictive modeling.
